# Visualization of Distribution of Video Games' Popularity across Platforms and Genres

The video game industry has experienced significant growth over the years, reaching a global value of $100 billion
in 2022. Video game sales data are important indicators for game developers, publishers, and gamers in understanding
trends and making informed purchase decisions. Critic and user scores, on the other hand, show the quality of a game
and its value to gamers and industry professionals. The speculation is that games with higher sales will generally
have a relatively high rating since the score will attract more people from buying the games. Sales might be
concentrated on some platforms since those consoles have a higher sale as well. Genre could be correlated with platform
since some platforms may be famous for having games in certain genres which attract people from buying the consoles
and the games. However, it will be interesting to see if there are outliers with this trend. In this project, we will
dive into the sales and critic scores of different games to analyze the impact of platforms and genres on sales records
and display the dashboard interactively and insightfully.
